# NEAT_CartPole

## Dependencies
Make sure you have successfully installed [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [gym](http://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation) onto your machine.

## Running the Program
There are two files used to solve the gym environment: config_gym.txt and gym_cartpole_neat.py. gym_config contains the config for the neuroevolution process and gym_solver.py is the program the creates the neural networks and solves the game. You will need to adjust parameters in both to solve a game.

If you open the gym_solver.py file with an IDE like VsCode, there will be a section at the top for user parameters.
